# DogRescueGroupDB
Web Database App for managing a Dog Rescue Team, PHP + PostgreSQL <br>
This application connects with a database running on a AGH Server, which is not available from outside of the university network. However, in the "DB" directory, one can find all of the SQL code needed for creating such a database.
Entry point for the Web Application is the index.php file, found in the "PHP" directory.
